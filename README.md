##
In this task, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow. The CNN was designed to automatically extract features from images and classify them into predefined categories. I started by selecting a suitable dataset, such as MNIST for handwritten digits or CIFAR-10 for general object classification, and applied preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation such as flipping, rotation, and zooming to improve the model’s generalization. The CNN model was constructed with multiple convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification. I applied ReLU activation functions to introduce non-linearity and a Softmax layer for outputting class probabilities. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function, with the training dataset split from validation and testing sets. I evaluated the model using accuracy and loss curves, classification reports, and confusion matrices, and visualized feature maps to understand what the CNN was learning. Image classification has broad applications, including healthcare for medical image diagnosis, security for facial recognition, autonomous vehicles for detecting objects and traffic signs, and e-commerce for visual product search. While CNNs are computationally intensive and require large datasets, they effectively eliminate manual feature extraction and achieve high accuracy in image recognition tasks. The Jupyter Notebook deliverable includes the CNN architecture, training process, evaluation metrics, and visualization of predictions. This project demonstrates the complete workflow of deep learning for computer vision, from preprocessing images to building, training, and evaluating a neural network capable of solving real-world image classification problems.
